# 🎨 My Portfolio Makeover Adventure
<br><br>

## 🌟 Background:
The objective of this project was not only to reimagine and renovate my portfolio but also to provide myself with an opportunity to write, execute, and run HTML codes 
along with utilizing CSS in a more traditional way to enhance my proficiency in them. I simply loved exploring and learning about it all, and it was a fun and adventurous project.

📁 I've added some starting points of HTML docs above (Now, I've perfected web techs), which were previsouly used in portfolio V1. Feel free to review them and you can use them if interested.<br><br>
📷 You can have a glimpse of how each iteration of graphic designs helped me come with a finalized appealing look of my portfolio. Feel free to [access images](https://imgur.com/a/oVnPeqP) 🔗 and have a look if interested.

##### 💡 Skill Enhancement:
* Obtained proficiency in utilizing HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS more efficiently and effectively.
* Built more knowledge and gained insights into them along with accelerating my confidence in building responsive webs and analytic apps.
<br><br><br>

## 🚀 Portfolio Development:
As I previously used HTML, Bootstrap, Mantine, and CSS during the development of my first app using the Plotly Dash library in Python, it wasn’t much of a hassle. 
However, learning about something new in its original form is what brings excitement to me, and it also keeps me motivated. So, in order to get 
familiarized with HTML and CSS in a more traditional manner, I started this project with a simple and first approach to utilize 
the functionality `Iframe` provided by Google Site and embed HTML codes in the predefined layout/blocks of the first page of this portfolio. Along the way 
of this development journey, I maybe missing something here, but I figured out that embedding HTML code with the anticipated results might not work with predefined
blocks in Google Site for all devices. So, the more I dug deeper into it, the more confident I became in writing and executing this code. 
Eventually, I started writing complete codes for the whole page while continuously ensuring and defining the responsiveness across various devices throughout the development.

Finally, after multiple iterations, trial runs, countless hours, and finally coming with final product, this project not only boosted my confidence but also made me feel 
fulfilled as an individual equipped with the necessary tools, enabling me to build analytic apps with ease of navigation and responsiveness.

#### Updates: 
I updated this portfolio through many versions starting with basic portfolio development to a fine-grained portfolio. In each version, I perfected my skills including HTML, CSS, Grid System, 
Designing skills, UI/UX with intuitive design and responsiveness, and project management. 

## 🛠️ Challenges Faced:
I initially used the predefined layout provided by Google Site, meaning that I used the existing base layout/foundation on which my portfolio was originally built. 
So, when I initially started embedding these HTML codes in the first page of the portfolio, I encountered challenges with the predefined blocks preventing the 
responsiveness across many devices. However, it was my curiosity that led me to figure this out.
<br><br>
So, for a better user experience, I started writing and executing codes for a whole page instead of relying on predefined layout blocks, and then embedded codes 
into each desired page. This resulted in a better outcome and provided me with long-lasting experience.

Updated | Jupy 2024 : Despite the above experience which I encountered during the initial phase of the web development, I came across a few more challenging scenarios including - 
integrating javascripts, modern and technical design of pages and such...However, through each version, I faced challenges, learned from them, and finally implemented 
robust solutions in the portfolio.

## 🎉 Final Outcome 🎉: 
<br><br>

### VERSION 01 : <span style="font-weight: thin;">Started executing HTML project with basic layouts and implemented them in Google Site using Iframe.</span>
### VERSION 02 : Addressed responsiveness of the embded elements and re-designed the whole pages with responsive elements 
### VERSION 03 : Adjusted the layout, typography, and colors of each phase. Addressed the space of web pages and designed
