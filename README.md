# :ðŸŽ¨ My Portfolio Makeover Adventure

### Background : 

The objective of this project was not only to reimagine and renovate my portfolio but also to provide myself with an opportunity to write, execute, and run HTML codes along with utilizing CSS in a more traditional way to enhance my proficiency in them. Since Iâ€™ve previously used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS during the development of my first app by using Plotly Dash library in Python, It wasnâ€™t much of a hassle. However, learning about something new in its original form is what brings excitement to me and it also helps me gain proficiency in it. So, in order to get familiarized with HTML and CSS in more sophisticated manner, I initialized this project with a simple and first approach to simply utilizing the functionality `Iframe` provided by Google Site and embed the HTML code into predefined layout of first page. The more I dug deeper into it, the more I became confident in writing and utilizing this code.

Finally, after multiple iterations, trial runs, and dedicated hours of effort, I finally equipped myself with these tools with proficiency while making sure each page of this portfolio is responsive across any devices. This project not only boosted my confidence but also made me feel fulfilled as an individual equipped with the necessary tools, enabling me to build websites/apps with ease of navigation and responsiveness.
