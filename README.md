# 🎨 My Portfolio Makeover Adventure

## 🌟 Background:
The objective of this project was not only to reimagine and renovate my portfolio but also to provide myself with an opportunity to write, execute, and run HTML codes 
along with utilizing CSS in a more traditional way to enhance my proficiency in them. I simply loved exploring and learning about it all, and it was a fun and adventurous project.

## 🚀 Portfolio Development:
Since I’ve previously used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS during the development of my first app using the Plotly Dash library in Python, it wasn’t much of a hassle. 
However, learning about something new in its original form is what brings excitement to me, and it also helps me gain proficiency in it. So, in order to get 
familiarized with HTML and CSS in a more traditional and sophisticated manner, I initialized this project with a simple and first approach to simply utilize 
the functionality Iframe provided by Google Site and embed HTML codes in the predefined layout/blocks of the first page of this portfolio. Along the way 
of this development journey, I might be wrong, but I figured out that embedding HTML code with the anticipated results might not work with predefined/existing 
blocks or layout for all devices. So, the more I dug deeper into it, the more confident I became in writing and executing this code. 
Eventually, I started writing complete codes for the whole page while continuously ensuring and defining the responsiveness across various devices throughout the development.

Finally, after multiple iterations, trial runs, and dedicated hours of effort, I ultimately equipped myself with these tools with proficiency while making sure each page 
of this portfolio is responsive across any devices. This project not only boosted my confidence but also made me feel 
fulfilled as an individual equipped with the necessary tools, enabling me to build analytic apps with ease of navigation and responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Challenges Faced:
I initially used the predefined layout provided by Google Site, meaning that I used the existing base layout/foundation on which my portfolio was originally built. 
So, when I initially started embedding these HTML codes in the first page of the portfolio, I encountered challenges with the predefined blocks preventing the 
responsiveness across many devices. However, it was my curiosity that led me to figure this out.

So, for a better user experience, I started writing and executing codes for a whole page instead of relying on predefined layout blocks, and then embedded codes into each desired page. This resulted in a better outcome and provided me with long-lasting experience.
