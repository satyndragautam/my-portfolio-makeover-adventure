# :ðŸŽ¨ My Portfolio Makeover Adventure

### Background : 

The objective of this project was not only to reimagine and renovate my portfolio but also to provide myself with an opportunity to write, execute, and run HTML codes along with utilizing CSS in a more traditional way to enhance my proficiency in them.

I've added html files above for your kind review and you can use them if interested.  

##### ðŸ’¡ Skill Enhancement : 
* Obtained proficiency in utilizing HTML, BOOTSTRAP, AND CSS more efficiently and effectively
* Built more knowledge and gained insights into them along with accelerating my confidence into building responsive webs and analytic apps with a better responsiveness across any devices.


### Portfolio Development : 

Since Iâ€™ve previously used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS during the development of my first app by using Plotly Dash library in Python, It wasnâ€™t much of a hassle. 
However, learning about something new in its original form is what brings excitement to me and it also helps me gain proficiency in it. So, in order to 
get familiarized with HTML and CSS in more traditional and sophisticated manner, I initialized this project with a simple and first approach to simply utilizing the 
functionality `Iframe` provided by Google Site and embedded HTML codes in predefined layout of first page of this portfolio. 
Along the way of this development journey, I might be wrong, but I figured out that embedding html code with the anticipated results might not work with predefined/existing blocks or layout for contents for all devices. 
So, the more I dug deeper into it, the more I became confident in writing and executing this code. 
Eventually, I decided to start writing complete codes for whole page while continuously ensuring and defining the responsiveness across various devices throughout the development.

Finally, after multiple iterations, trial runs, and dedicated hours of effort, I finally equipped myself with these tools with proficiency 
while making sure each page of this portfolio is responsive across any devices. This project not only boosted my confidence but also made me feel fulfilled as an individual equipped with the necessary tools, 
enabling me to build websites/apps with ease of navigation and responsiveness.

### Challenge Faced : 
I initially used the predefined layout provided by Google Site, meaning that I used the existing base layout/foundation on which my portfolio was originally built. 
So, when I initially started embedding these HTML codes in the **first page** of portfolio, I encountered challenges with the predefined blocks preventing the responsiveness across many devices. However, It was my curiosity that led me figure this out. 

So, for a better user experience and responsiveness, I started writing and executing codes for a whole page instead of using predefined layout blocks and then embedded codes into each desired page. This resulted in a better outcome and provided me with long-lasting experience. 


### Final Outcome : 
From Drab to Fab :
